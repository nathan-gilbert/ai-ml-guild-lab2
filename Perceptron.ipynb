    "## Perceptron Training Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosenblatt had a hypothesis on how to train neurons based on his intuition about biological neurons. He intuited a simple learning algorithm. His idea was to run each example input through the perceptron and, if the perceptron is correct then \"excite\" its weights. If the perceptron was incorrect, then \"inhibit\" its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we inhibit or excite? We change the weight vector and bias. The weight vector is a parameter to the perceptron. We need to keep changing it until we can correctly classify each of our training examples. With this intuition in mind, we need to write an update rule for our weight vector so that we can appropriately change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can define an error function as the difference between the desired output **d** and the predicted output **y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`e = d - y`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when **d** and **y** are the same (both are 0 or both are 1), we get 0! When they are different, (0 and 1 or 1 and 0), we can get either 1 or -1. This directly corresponds to exciting and inhibiting our perceptron. We multiply this with the input to tell our perceptron to change our weight vector in proportion to our input.\n",
    "\n",
    "`w' = w + lr * e * x`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a hyperparameter `lr` that is called the learning rate. It is a scaling factor that determines how large the weight vector updates should be. This is a _hyperparameter_ because it is not learned by the perceptron (notice there’s no update rule for `lr`), but we, the data scientist, select this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the Perceptron Convergence Theorem says that a perceptron will converge, given that the classes are linearly separable, regardless of the learning rate. But for other learning algorithms, this is a critical parameter! For our example, `lr` can potentially speed up the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tldr** When the error  is 0, i.e., the output is what we expect, then we don’t change the weight vector at all. When the error is nonzero, we update the weight vector accordingly."
